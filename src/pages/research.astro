                My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision and geometric deep learning. Researching robust and effective methods to process 2D and 3D data is important for machine learning systems to be able to understand and interact with their surroundings. There are numerous applications where this is useful, including robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving. For real-time use cases though, efficient algorithms are needed and often, there isn't an abundance of labeled data available to train on.

            <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                I am particularly interested in addressing those challenges by leveraging the known symmetries of real world visual data, such as rotation and translation invariance. By incorporating these symmetries into the architecture of neural networks, we can create models that require fewer training data and are less sensitive to noisy inputs.
