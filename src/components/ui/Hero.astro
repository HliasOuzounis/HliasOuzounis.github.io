        I believe that researching efficient algorithms that process 2D and 3D
        data can revolutionize the way machine learning models understand and
        interact with the world. Due to the inherent symmetries of visual data,
        I am particularly interested the intersection of group theory and deep
        learning to develop robust and generalizable models.

        I am currently seeking a PhD position in computer vision and geometric
        deep learning. If you have any opportunities or would like to connect,
